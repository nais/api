Durations are expressed as human-readable strings composed of decimal numbers followed by unit suffixes. Supported units are:

| Unit     | Meaning      | Example |
| :------- | :----------- | :------ |
| ns       | nanoseconds  | `150ns` |
| us or Âµs | microseconds | `250us` |
| ms       | milliseconds | `500ms` |
| s        | seconds      | `45s`   |
| m        | minutes      | `3m`    |
| h        | hours        | `2h`    |

Durations can combine multiple units, e.g. `1h30m`, `2h45m30s`, or `300ms`.

A leading - sign indicates a negative duration, e.g. `-15m`.
